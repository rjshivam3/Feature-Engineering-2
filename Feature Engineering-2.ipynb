    "## Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method in feature selection involves selecting features based on their statistical properties such as correlation, mutual information, chi-square statistics, etc., independently of the predictive model. It works by ranking or scoring each feature based on these metrics and selecting the top-ranked features."

    "## Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates feature subsets using the predictive model's performance. It selects features based on how well a model performs with a specific subset of features, iterating through various combinations to find the optimal subset."

    "\n",
    "Embedded feature selection methods include techniques like Lasso regression, Ridge regression, and decision trees (such as Random Forests). These methods perform feature selection as part of the model construction process, penalizing coefficients or using feature importance scores to determine which features are most influential."

    "- Independence from the model: It doesn't consider interactions between features that might be crucial for predictive performance.\n",
    "- Static selection: Once features are selected, they typically aren't reconsidered even if model performance could improve with different features."
